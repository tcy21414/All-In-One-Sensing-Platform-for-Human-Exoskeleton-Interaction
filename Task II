# Metabolic State Classification using IMU and EMG Signals

This repository provides a deep learning pipeline for classifying metabolic states using synchronized wearable sensor data, including 18-channel Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) signals and 6-channel Electromyography (EMG) signals. The system integrates a Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN) for IMU and a Squeeze-and-Excitation ResNet (SE-ResNet) for EMG.

> ðŸ§  Designed for 3-second fixed context signals + 6-second sliding window samples (9000 timepoints @ 1000Hz).
